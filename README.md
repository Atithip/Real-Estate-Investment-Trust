# Real-Estate-Investment-Trust
## Real Estate Investment Trust likes to start investing in Residential real estate. I will be determining the market price of a house given a set of features. I will analyze and predict housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and so on. 
## Dataset Used : The dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. It was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction
